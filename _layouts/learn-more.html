        <h2>Attention Economy Model</h2>
        <p>Designing an attention economy is about making people more effective agents through the careful management of their attention We design a "social brain", shaping both inputs and outputs of information in ways that reflect our users' own estimation of value. This way, Synereo optimizes your ability to achieve your goals, social or otherwise.</p>

        <h3>Reo</h3>
        <p>Reo is a measure of your reputation as a publisher of attention-worthy content. It is a tool for shaping the information flow around a social consensus. Reo is calculated from the point of view of each user as they receive information from another, changing based on the slice of the network they share with the user trying for their attention. This means that a person who has the attention of the peers in your community will have an easier time reaching you as well.</p>

        <h3>Stream</h3>
        <p>The Stream is the basic information organizing mechanism in Synereo. Messages and posts broadcast to you with different Currents essentially bid for your attention, becoming prioritized just for you in the process. [the visuals should reflect this] Configuring the Stream is easy, affecting specific types of Current reaching you from different contacts, apps, and areas on the network. Feel like increasing the chances of seeing musical content? Just turn up the dial, and posts from Bandcamp receive a h igher priority.</p>

        <h3>AMPs</h3>
        <p>Think your post deserves more attention than it can achieve organically? AMPs, Synereoâ€™s information flow currency, serve as a way to AMPlify your content's ability to propagate to peers and ups the chances of it being seen by more users - through increasing its Current. Users receiving AMPlified content will receive a portion of the attached AMPs, more if their Reo score is high. If your content is AMPlified, a portion of the AMPs will come to you as a reward!</p>

        <h2>Distributed Technology Stack</h2>
        <p>Synereo's technology has been in development for four and a half years and represents the cutting edge of the peer to peer stack. With it, users are assured complete privacy, total identity ownership and data control, and even anonymity - if they seek it. The network has no single point of failure and is incredibly resilient to take-down attempts, as it allows any two or more peers to communicate directly.</p>

        <h3>DendroNet</h3>
        <p>The DEndron is Synereo's local consensus-keeping mechanism, decentralized ledger, and distributed content model. Every user on Synereo has their own fraction of it, their Dendrite, maintaining a view of the part of the network relevant to them. A user's Dendrite is constantly updated with information received from peers: social information from friends, changing the Dendrite's affinity to them based on the attention model; meta-data and keys to encrypted data hosted on the SpecialK distributed cloud; and information saved on their Dendrite itself, used in the consensus-keeping process.</p>

        <h3>Extensibility</h3>
        <p>Synereo is built not just to stand on its own, but more importantly to be extended through other applications. By using Synereo's Network Model API and Attention Economy API, developers can extend the network in unimaginable ways, and leverage the power of the decentralized network and the attention economy to create better, smarter applications. While the Network Model API enables developers to interact with the Synereo application layer, specify content policies, work with the Synereo node graph, and build tools to manage their communities, the Attention Economy API provides the tools required to implement innovative protocols that enable the new era of social organizing.</p>

        <h3>Censorship Resilience</h3>
        <p>As a full-fledged peer-to-peer network, Synereo is resilient to censorship attacks carried out by anyone who is out to attempt to control the free flow of information. Centralized services can be coerced into cooperating with the powers-that-be; a true decentralized network cannot be censored. Taking down a peer-to-peer network means taking down the Internet in its entirety. With Synereo, your content is there for whomever wants to see it, and cannot be blocked.</p>

        <h3>Gateways</h3>
        <p>While Synereo is a completely decentralized network, we understand that not everyone is able to deploy a personal Synereo node on their own computation device. To that end, Synereo will provide centralized gateways that enable end users to use and enjoy the benefits of the network without having to run and maintain a node. Gateways don't control or have access to your information, and should they go down, the key they send you upon account creation can be used to boot up your node (with all of your information) immediately if you download a client and plug the key in.</p>
